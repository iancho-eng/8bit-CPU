# 8bit-CPU
Discrete-logic 8-bit CPU with schematics and report (PCB in progress)

This project is a fully functional 8-bit CPU built from a combination of 74LS-series TTL chips and 74HCT CMOS chips, designed and documented as both a learning platform and a demonstration of classic computer architecture. Inspired by Ben Eaterâ€™s 8-bit computer, it implements the fetchâ€“decodeâ€“execute cycle with a microcoded control unit, LED instrumentation, and 7-segment output displays. The system was first prototyped on breadboards, then migrated into KiCad schematics and PCB layouts, with extensive documentation provided in the report and supporting diagrams.
